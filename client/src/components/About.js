    <h2>Our Approach (Shot)</h2>
    <p>At Stroke Thief, we are motivated by no longer sucking at golf. To take it a step further, we want to help every golfer reach their 'next threshold of 10'. If you're shooting in the 100s we want you to shoot a 99 and if you're shooting in the 80s we want you to shoot a 79. Our approach towards game improvement follows three simple principles:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Play stress free golf by adjusting your scorecard based on your handicap.</li>
      <li>Keep track of the shots that are hurting your score - putts, duffs, and OBs. But also keep track of the 'did I just do that?' shots that keep you coming back for more.</li>
      <li>Practice your weaknesses when you're not on the course whether you're in your office, your bedroom, or at the range.</li>
    </ol>
